appgen is a command line utility that kickstarts the process of setting up a new application project directory by collecting information, running scripts and cloning from an customizable assortment of templates. appgen is not tied down to any one framework or API but it's original design it for Node.js projects.  

appgen is inspired by the idea of bringing the concept of Rails generators (with vastly expanded options) to Node.js.  

## APPGEN IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT 
but it's nearing the point of having a usable build. I don't recommend running it at this time but you can certainly have a look a the source!
